This project was supposed to be a web service for help the coordinations of costumers of an [Ethical purchasing groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_purchasing_groups).

We wrote it for an university course assignment. It  lacks in many aspects: worst of all it is made on Spring Roo, which was supposed to speedup the developing but made our work hell. 

Anyway, it can be a (bad) example of how a Spring MVC and Roo projects are made and furthermore it has also a nice implementation of push notification through WebSockets using [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) framework.
